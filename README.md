# xmas-puzzle-2021

This is a simple HTML puzzle that I created as part of an escape room my wife and I created for the family at Christmas time. 
A prior puzzle gave them the password to a login on a laptop hidden on a bookshelf, and solving this puzzle gave them a clue 
to continue their escape.

To play it, just open hohoho.html, which is a self-contained web page.
